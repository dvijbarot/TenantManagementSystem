# TenantManagementSystem
 
This is a software system developed to manage the rental units of a real estate company. The system allows the company to keep track of their properties, tenants, and leases, and also provides a centralized accounting system for rent payments. The project uses Java and JavaFX for the GUI and includes a custom implementation of a Set class. The system has been designed using appropriate design patterns and fully implemented with unit tests.
